# DSPServer
This folder contains a first complete DSP-server project: A new polyphonic synthesizer which is VERY much a work-in-progress. The project references all the files under the **AudioKit** folder tree (one level up); the source files in this folder are representative of what any DSP server program needs.

Right now, there is only a MS Visual Studio 2017 project here, but the plan is to add projects for other compilers/IDEs, most particularly
- Xcode 9.x (Mac build)
- gcc/Makefile (Linux, *BSD, etc.)
- JetBrains [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) (Windows, Mac, and Linux)

Go to the **WebGUI** folder (one level up) to see how this is used.
