# AudioKit

This folder contains a COPY of part of the AudioKit/Core tree from the
[main AudioKit repo](http://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit/).

The idea is that this code will eventually go into the main AudioKit/Core tree (once it's developed, debugged and cleaned-up), and so we keep the tree structure and folder names basically identical.

Everything here can be treated as a "branch" of the AudioKit/Core code which is even newer than the [Develop](https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit/tree/develop) branch in the main repo. Anything goes when modifying this code, including massive refactoring/restructuring, because as long as this code is only here, it's not necessary to update the [main AudioKit repo](http://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit/) to be compatible.
