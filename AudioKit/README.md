#AudioKit
This folder contains a COPY of part of the AudioKit/Core tree from the main **AudioKit** repo.

The idea is that this code will eventually go into the main AudioKit/Core tree (once it's developed, debugged and cleaned-up), and so we keep the tree structure and folder names basically identical.

Everything here can be treated as a "branch" of the AudioKit/Core code which is even newer than the *Develop* branch in the main repo. Anything goes when modifying this code, including massive refactoring/restructuring, because as long as this code is only here, it's not necessary to update the main **AudioKit** repo to be compatible.
